I created a Customer class which has the basic discount of 0.05
Then, I created 2 subclasses(child class) of Customer class - SeniorCustomer and PreferredCustomer.

getDiscountRate() is overrided in both the child classes.

the customer object is passed in Sale's object. based on the which customer object is passed,
as per dynamic polymorphism, the corresponding customer object's getDiscountRate() method is called.

the getDiscountRate() further calls parent's class getDiscountRate() method to get the basic discount.
and it gets added with the additional discount.
