1. I created enum to define CustomerType(GENERAL, SENIOR, PREFERRED),
the customer type is passed in the Sale costructor while creating the object.
In getDiscountRate() method, switch case is used to set the discount rate according to the
customer type.

Test case is created for Preferred customer to test the use case and differentiate the discount
percentage.
